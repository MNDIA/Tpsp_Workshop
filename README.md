# ToaruPsp_Workshop
Here is the texture replacement pack repository for tpsp
Includes: base pack, DLC, UI, characters, drawings, weapons, native classes
Feel free to download or upload your favorite texture files
Each texture pack has the same format, with a screenshot for reference

If there are players who don't know how to use texture packs
We also provide the software to install [game], [online software], [textures] with one click (Chinese version)
Hope you have fun!


Basic package:
Original style HD textures without any modifications, suitable for everyone
(The full base pack has too many unused/highly configurable textures, we have made this part of the textures available as DLC)
(Base pack and DLC files are in the process of being released as they are too big)
All bulk textures are used based on the [base pack]
To use them, you need to use the base pack first.
Then overwrite them into the [base package] structure
Because the material hash mapping files are unified in the base package

DLC:
is a 4K remake of the original style textures, separated from the base pack
Single texture quality up to 2048x2048, if you like high quality, you can install
1. Model pack (using a variety of processing methods to create textures, very high definition)
2. Map package (the same method as above to create the scene texture, normal combat rarely notice the scene)
3. Plot package (the same method as above to create the story textures, players who like to play the story can install)
4. Mobile phone special edition (based on low configuration equipment model textures, clarity will not lose too much, the main focus of smooth combat)

UI:
Modified the collection of bulk textures for various interface tips
For example: life bar, hit count table, main menu text, etc.

Role:
Modified a collection of bulk textures for various character appearances

Drawings:
Modified a collection of bulk textures for various stand-ups on the character selection screen

Weapons:
Modified a collection of loose textures for the appearance of various character weapons
For example: Gohe's lance, Tsuchimikado's pistol, and Misaka 10032's rifle

Native-like:
All textures similar to the original style, you can install if you like the original textures


Manual use.
Enable the texture replacement function of PPSSPP simulator.
Find the structure and name of the texture material folder generated by PPSSPP: [texture\ULJS00329]
Simply overwrite the texture package folder with the same structure into a directory with the same structure

Note: All texture packs are downloaded using the [zip] format
but all texture packs use the folder and file [png]
instead of zip [zip, 7z, rar].
The [zip] obtained after downloading needs to be unzipped before use.
